# The Game: Snake. Using only an Arduino Nano, and a VGA screen!
Who doesn't like the game snake? who hasn't spent days and nights playing it when we were younger?

This was a successful attempt to build the game snake, but using nothing but an arduino nano, and connecting it directly with a VGA monitor.

The code was tested on arduino Uno, but it will work just fine with any arduino board.
